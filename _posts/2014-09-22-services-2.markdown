description: |
  <p class="lead">For any photograph that's part of Elog.io, you can
  choose to copy the photo as an HTML fragment that includes the
  attribution. Perfect for pasting into LibreOffice, Word, Wordpress,
  or any other application that can manage HTML. For those that don't,
  we include the option to copy just the attribution string as text as
  well.
