<a name="general"></a><h2>What is Elog.io?</h2>
<p>
Elog.io is a browser extension that sit in your browser and gives you
an opportunity to explore the photos that you encounter while browsing.
For any of the photographs that are part of the Elog.io catalog, it can
tell you information about the author of the photo, where it's from, and what
permissions are associated with the photo.
</p>
<p>
The catalog that powers Elog.io contain information about 22 million
photographs, many of which are in the public domain or openly licensed,
which means that they are among the photos that are most frequently
re-used across the web. For these photographs, Elog.io also gives the
option of copying the photograph, including attribution and license
information, with a simple copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
Aside from finding information about photographs, Elog.io offer ways
to connect to the photographer by giving a source link to the original
photograph. Elog.io is built to scale. Coming features include
ways for the owner of a photograph to see where others using Elog.io
has found their photograph on the web, as well as more ways to include
other types of media in Elog.io, music &amp; video especially.

<a name="founder"></a><h2>Who runs Elog.io?</h2>
<p>
Elog.io was founded by <a href="http://jonasoberg.net/">Jonas Öberg</a> and
is currently supported by <a href="http://commonsmachinery.se/">Commons
Machinery</a> and <a href="http://shuttleworthfoundation.org">Shuttleworth
Foundation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Jonas is a Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow where he works on enabling
persistent links between digital work and their creators. Prior to his
work with the Shuttleworth Foundation, he was the Regional Coordinator
for Creative Commons in Europe, a region stretching from Kazkhstan to
Iceland. He has worked as a lecturer in Software Engineering at the
University of Gothenburg and co-founded the Free Software Foundation
Europe where he also served as vice president for seven years.

<a name="why"></a><h2>Why Elog.io?</h2>
<p>
There are two reasons why Elog.io exists. When Jonas was working with
Creative Commons, he saw first hand the problems people have attributing
photographs they use from the web. Even if they use Creative Commons licensed
photographs, which permit re-use, it's difficult to do accurate attribution,
and sometimes difficult to even find enough information so that you can
attribute. Elog.io works to overcome this by offering information relevant
to create accurate attributions, and by offering a way to automatically
attribute images you copy.
</p>
<p>
The second reason Elog.io exists is because it's simply the right thing to
have. Regardless of how a photograph is licensed, giving an accurate 
attribution help people viewing that photograph to understand it in its
context. By following a link back to the source, they understand where the
photograph come from, and can find out more about the photographer. This
makes photographs online more valuable, it gives them meaning, and it
contributes to building a reputation for the photographer.</p>

<a name="quotes"></a><h2>Voices about Elog.io</h2>
<blockquote>
When we started working with Jonas, we thought it was just about
automating the process of attribution, but we learned that there's
more at stake here: knowing where a photograph comes and who took it
is crucial to understand it. I'd never go to a museum or gallery that
had no information about their exhibits! And I hope that I'll one day
have that information when i browse the web too. - Helen Turvey, CEO of
<a href="http://shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth Foundation</a>.
