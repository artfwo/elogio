<h2>Temporary information</h2>
<p>
 When Elog.io is turned on, it searches the web pages you're viewing for
 images and queries the Elog.io servers for information about those images.
 The information it sends to the Elog.io servers consists of the image URLs
 and (if you click "Query Elog.io", a calculated hash value representing
 the image). Your connection to Elog.io is sent through a load balancer that
 removes the originating IP address. This means that from the Elog.io server's
 side, it will only see a sequence of URLs and hash values, without knowing
 the relationship between them or the origin of each.
</p>
<p>
 The Elog.io extensions don't send any other identifying information to
 the servers, and no information is stored in the Elog.io database about
 your request after it has been processed.
</p>
<p>
 Elog.io is explicitly deactivated when you're browsing in a private or
 incognito sesssion.
</p>

<h2>Stored information</h2>
<p>
 If you submit feedback through the Elog.io extension, or report information,
 we will store the information you provided for our own handling. We will
 store this information for as long as we need it to act on your report or
 feedback.
</p>
<p>
 Our servers are hosted in London, United Kingdom.
</p>

<h2>Catalog information</h2>
<p>
 The Elog.io catalog contain information about openly licensed photographs
 published through Wikimedia Commons. If you have included or contributed to
 photographs on Wikimedia Commons, your information is also included in
 Elog.io.

 Should you have any questions or concerns in relation to our handling
 of your information, or the information of any 3rd party, we encourage
