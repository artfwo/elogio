<h2>Welcome to Elog.io!</h2>
<p>
 A huge welcome to Elog.io! We've put together some information to help
 you get started exploring Elog.io. If there's something we've forgotten,
 we'd love to hear from you. Just use the feedback button from within the
 plugin, tweet to us on <a href="http://twitter.com/elog_io">@elog_io</a>
 or write to us on <a href="mailto:hello@elog.io">hello@elog.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
 We'd love to treat you with our very own Elog.io #attributionrevolution
 t-shirt. Just fill out the <a href="/tshirt/">t-shirt order form</a> and
 we'll get it to you soonest - for free - as a thank you for trying out
 Elog.io.
</p>
<p>
 Here are three sample images to get you started with exploring Elog.io.
 They're all from Wikimedia Commons, but we've "forgotten" to include an
 attribution for them. See if you can find your way to the source with
 Elog.io!

<h3>Worth knowing</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Copy as HTML</strong> - you can copy an image including its attribution as a HTML snippet. This works in Word, LibreOffice, Wordpress, and many other places, but it won't work in programs that can't work with HTML.</li>
  <li><strong>We're Free and Open Source!</strong> - Elog.io is a Free and Open Source project, you can find out more details on our <a href="/dev/">developer's page</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>We've indexed Wikimedia Commons</strong> - if an image you search for is among the 22 million images in Wikimedia Commons, chances are good we'll find it. We haven't started working on importing any other images yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Our matching algorithms work best with verbatim use</strong> - resizing, changing formats between jpg and png should all be fine, but if you modify an image, add a border, crop or replace parts, it's a derivative work, and our algorithm will likely not find it.</li>
   <li><strong>We appreciate feedback!</strong> - negative or positive, we'll take it all, just leave a note with the feedback button in the plugin, or, if you find incorrect data in the information, by clicking Report.</li>
   <li><strong>The images above?</strong> - if you can't find them through Elog.io, we'd love to know what happens! (it should work) But in the mean time, you can get their license and other metadata information in their <a href="/img/samples/README">README</a></li>
</ul>
